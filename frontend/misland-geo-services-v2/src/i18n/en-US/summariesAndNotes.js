    climate_erosivity: `The influence of climate on wind erosion process does not only depend on the wind speed but
      also on the soil moisture conditions of the soil. Accordingly, wind data as well as rainfall and
      evapotranspiration data is needed to compute the climatic erosivity.`,
    erodible_fraction: `The erodibility factor represents the susceptibility of soil to the erosive force of wind and was
      assessed using multiple regression equation to predict the
      wind erodible fraction of soils based on soil texture and soil chemical properties`,
    soil_crust_factor: `Soil Crust creates a thin consolidated layer at the soil surface that is more compact and mechanically stable and more resistant to abrasion by blowing soil and erodes at a lower rate
      than loose bare soil below. In arid areas Soil crust plays a critical role in
      reducing wind erosion by abrasion.`,
    vegetation_cover_sensitivity: `vegetation cover has a sheltering effect on soil from the erosive force
      of wind. 20% vegetation cover on
      a field can reduce soil erosion by half as compared to bare surfaces, whereas permanently bare
      soil and arable lands left bare are the most susceptible to wind erosion.`,
    roughness_index: `Roughness length represent landscape conditions that affect the wind
      erosion process by dissipating the erosive force of wind by providing efficient sheltering effect. MISLAND uses the surface roughness index data provided by the global wind atlas.`,
    wind_erosion: `Land susceptibility to wind erosion is the result of the multiplication
    of the wind erosion driving force (CE) for four decreasing factors (EF, SC, VC and SR).  The sensitivity values were assigned on pixel basis form 0 to 1  by reclassifying the original
    factors using predefined fuzzy logic membership functions depending on the relationship between each factor and wind erosion`,
