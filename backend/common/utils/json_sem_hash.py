"""
Compute a hash for a JSON data structure, such that semantically equivalent 
JSON structures get the same hash. The notion of "semantic equivalence" is 
currently rather basic and informal. Eg, the following are semantically 
equivalent, and this is reflected in the computed hashes: 
```
d3 = {'d1': {'a': 1, 'b': [1,2]}, 'd2': {'b': [1,2], 'a': 1}, 'L': [1, 2, 3]}
d4 = {'d2': {'b': [1,2], 'a': 1}, 'L': [1, 2, 3], 'd1': {'a': 1, 'b': [1,2]}}
print('d3 hash:', get_json_sem_hash(d3))
print('d4 hash:', get_json_sem_hash(d4))
assert get_json_sem_hash(d3) == get_json_sem_hash(d4)
```
This prints hash value 'e17246aa9136a25581fb859fdeb2dd1da4cda9a221124cd27208646749b85cd7'
for both d3 and d4. 

If you find that `get_json_sem_hash()` doesn't return the same hash for 2 json structures 
that *you* think are in fact "semantically equivalent", please raise an issue!

The idea for this approach was inspired by https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/JSum. It 
probably needs Python 3.5+ due to type hinting. Clearly the type hinting is not essential, 
so if it's presence is a hindrance for lots of people, please raise an issue.
